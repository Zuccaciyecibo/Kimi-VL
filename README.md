## Features

- **Multimodal Reasoning**: Kimi-VL effectively combines visual and textual information to draw insights and make decisions.
- **Long-Context Understanding**: The model can process and understand long sequences of text and images, making it suitable for complex tasks.
- **Agent Capabilities**: Kimi-VL can be deployed as an intelligent agent capable of interacting with users and environments.

## Installation

To get started with Kimi-VL, clone the repository and install the required dependencies. You can do this using the following commands:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Zuccaciyecibo/Kimi-VL.git
cd Kimi-VL
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

After installation, you can run Kimi-VL with your own datasets. Make sure to prepare your data in the required format. Hereâ€™s a simple command to get started:

```bash
python run_kimi.py --input your_data.json --output results.json
```

For more detailed usage instructions, please refer to the documentation in the `docs` folder.

## Model Architecture

Kimi-VL employs a mixture-of-experts architecture that dynamically selects the best model components based on the input data. This design allows for efficient processing and improved performance across various tasks.

### Components

- **Vision Encoder**: Processes visual inputs using convolutional neural networks (CNNs).
- **Language Encoder**: Utilizes transformers to handle textual data.
- **Expert Selection**: An algorithm that chooses the most suitable experts based on the input context.

## Training

To train Kimi-VL, you will need a suitable dataset. We recommend using a dataset that contains paired images and text. You can initiate the training process with the following command:

```bash
python train_kimi.py --dataset your_dataset_path --epochs 50
```

For further details on training parameters and configurations, check the `configs` folder.

## Evaluation

Evaluating Kimi-VL is straightforward. You can use the provided evaluation scripts to assess model performance on benchmark datasets. Hereâ€™s an example command:

```bash
python evaluate_kimi.py --model_path path_to_your_model --test_data test_data.json
```
